    "To run a contact center that’s both efficient and cost-effective, you need to align people, processes, and resources with the company’s key business objectives. Workforce management (WFM) is crucial for the success of any call center. But building out a WFM function is often easier said than done, especially without the right tools or frameworks. In this article, we’ll cover the main components of workforce management for call centers and walk through how to impact these metrics—including top WFM software tools to consider. This article contains: (click on the links below to jump to a specific section) Let’s get started. What is call center workforce management? Workforce management in a call center is a set of ongoing internal processes that help ensure:  A workforce management cycle usually involves the following components: 1. Forecasting A call center may experience regular fluctuations in call volumes due to external factors.  If a call center doesn’t have enough agents during heavy call inflow, it may lead to long waiting queues and an unsatisfactory customer experience. On the other hand, overstaffing results in poor resource management and added costs.  Accurate forecasting helps managers or WFM analysts plan ahead by accurately predicting the workload and staffing needs.  They usually consider factors like: 2. Agent scheduling and assigning After anticipating the staffing requirements, the WFM team creates agent schedules by determining the time and duration of the shifts.  The scheduling and assigning process has three main objectives: Advanced WFM software uses technologies such as call pattern analysis and skills based routing to assign agents most suitable for the job. 3. Intraday management The WFM team constantly monitors real-time call data to ensure everything goes as per the schedule and there are enough agents to meet customer demand. However, despite thorough planning, a call center team may face scenarios that could affect their service level. There could be an unexpected workforce shortage due to employee absenteeism or poor schedule adherence by the agents.  There could also be sudden spikes in the volume of inbound calls due to: Intraday management involves taking reactive measures to restore normal functioning and the service level.  Some of these measures include: Intraday management practices help restore the call center operations after a disruptive event has taken place.  However, it’s a good practice for a call center or contact center to prepare for such events in advance and develop a solid business continuity plan.  Your WFM team must identify as many such disruptive scenarios and come up with preventive measures. Additionally, they must create an SOP (standard operating procedure) for each one of them.  4. Performance management For many call centers, performance management is a part of WFM rather than a separate quality management system. The main goal of performance management is to monitor agent performance and help them improve over time.  To get a clear insight into agent performance, an operations manager or a WFM analyst regularly tracks metrics such as: Once they identify a productivity or performance issue, they can give actionable feedback to the agents or ask them to undergo additional training. How WFM teams can measure and impact call center metrics To execute these processes efficiently, WFM teams need goals that align with the components above. Lets look at how call center managers can measure and impact key performance indicators (KPIs). Cost management With more historical data and keener knowledge of consumer trends, managers can develop more informed call center forecasts. Using that data, they can ensure enough they have the right number of agents without over-scheduling. Greater forecast accuracy typically means better cost management. Experienced contact center managers can use dedicated tools (see below) to forecast needs and estimate costs. Customer satisfaction Cutting costs too much can lead to lengthy answer times and high rates of call abandonment. Both of these factors can cause customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) to plummet. With dedicated call center software, managers can measure CSAT and related metrics like net promoter score (NPS) automatically. Then they can balance these success metrics with budget needs. Operational efficiency When workdays go smoothly and forecasts prove accurate, call centers can run efficiently. But when unexpected scenarios arise, call center managers need a plan B. Tracking preparation measures like SOPs and business continuity plans is the first step. Managers can also use WFM tools to set benchmarks and identify inefficiencies that require resolution. Agent retention Contact center agents with predictable schedules, manageable workloads, and opportunities to grow tend to be happy employees. Managers can impact these outcomes with tactics like automatic call distribution and skill-based routing. Managers can also use workforce management software to track agent engagement KPIs. Naturally, higher engagement rates often correlate with higher retention, which ties into cost management and operational efficiency. 8 WFM software tools to improve call center operations The right WFM software can help you run your contact center more efficiently, improve budget forecasting, and lead to happier call center agents.
